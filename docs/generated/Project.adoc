.Fields
* `locales` _(required)_
+
Type: `Map<String, <<ProjectDesc>>>`
+
Strings for describing the project.
+
This is a map from a language code (ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-3) to a project
description in that language. If a language has both an ISO 639-1 or ISO
639-3 code, prefer the 639-1 variant for better support.
+
The project description must be defined for at least the `en` locale,
and preferably also for each well-supported locale that you expect to
support.
