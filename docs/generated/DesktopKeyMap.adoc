= DesktopKeyMap

Map of keys on a desktop keyboard

A full keymap has 48 items. It has two forms of representation, a
string-based one with 12 items per line; the other representation is a
regular YAML map. Some keys might be omitted, which is represented as
`\u{0}` (the unicode escape for a `NULL` byte) in the string representation
or `None` in the map.

We will try to serialize everything that is more than half of a full map as
string-based key map; other sizes will be regular maps in YAML.
